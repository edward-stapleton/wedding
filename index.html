                    With the exception of close family, the ceremony and reception will be adult-only. However, we recognise that some
                    of you will be travelling with your children, so please know they are welcome at the Friday cricket match.

                  <h3>Flying</h3>
                  <p>If you&rsquo;re travelling from overseas &mdash; thank you! London has several major airports with good connections to Oxford:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Heathrow Airport (LHR):</strong> Heathrow is the closest major airport to Oxford. The journey by car is around 70 minutes.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Gatwick Airport (LGW):</strong> From Gatwick, the Airline coach also offers a direct service to Oxford, running every hour and taking about 2 hours 15 minutes. You can also take a train from Gatwick to Reading, then change for a direct train to Oxford (around 2 hours total).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Luton Airport (LTN) and Stansted Airport (STN):</strong> Both airports are further away, but still manageable. The easiest route is to take a train or coach into London and then continue by train from either Paddington or Marylebone to Oxford. Total travel time is usually around 2.5&ndash;3 hours.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                  <h3>Train</h3>
                  <p>Oxford is very easy to reach from London by train:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      <strong>From London Paddington:</strong> Direct trains to Oxford run frequently (about every 15&ndash;30 minutes) with Great Western Railway (GWR). The journey takes around 50&ndash;70 minutes, depending on the service.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>From London Marylebone:</strong> You can also travel with Chiltern Railways from London Marylebone. These trains take about 1 hour to 1 hour 15 minutes, arriving at Oxford or Oxford Parkway station.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>
                    Once in Oxford, the main station is just a short walk or taxi ride from the city centre and most hotels. Tickets can be booked in advance through the National Rail website or apps like Trainline for the best prices.
                  </p>
                  <h3>Car</h3>
                  <p>
                    If you prefer to drive, Oxford is about 65 miles north-west of London and is easily reached via the M40. The journey typically takes around an hour or two, depending on traffic. There is plenty of parking at the reception venue and some street parking near the church.

                <div class="accordion-panel" hidden>
                  <p>
                    Please arrive at the church at 12:45 for a 13:00 ceremony start. You can find more details about the day&rsquo;s schedule in the section above.
                  </p>

                <div class="accordion-panel" hidden>
                  <p>
                    After the ceremony, our journey to The Medley Walled Garden will be part of the day&rsquo;s experience; a short stroll across Port Meadow with beautiful riverside views and the odd cow or horse.
                  </p>
                  <h3>On foot (recommended)</h3>
                  <p>
                    The walk takes around 15 minutes at a leisurely pace. There's no need to worry about directions &mdash; we'll have local sherpas (Ed's friends) guiding the way, so everyone can relax and enjoy the scenery. Ladies &mdash; we recommend bringing a pair of comfortable flats to make the meadow stroll more enjoyable.
                  </p>
                  <h3>By taxi or car</h3>
                  <p>
                    If walking isn&rsquo;t ideal, taxis or car lifts take around 5&ndash;10 minutes, and local taxi services can be booked in advance. Parking at the Medley Walled Garden is plentiful, and cars can be picked up the next day.
                  </p>
                </div>
              </div>

                <button type="button" aria-expanded="false">Is the wedding indoors or outdoors?</button>
                <div class="accordion-panel" hidden>
                  <p>
                    Our wedding ceremony will be indoors, the drinks reception will be outdoors (weather permitting!), and dinner and dancing will be in a marquee.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    We'd love you to come dressed formally so ladies, please come wearing dresses or jumpsuits. If you&rsquo;re planning to join the stroll across Port Meadow, make sure to bring or wear a comfy pair of shoes or flats. Gentlemen, don your lounge suits with a shirt and tie, or morning suits if you'd prefer.
                  </p>

                <button type="button" aria-expanded="false">Is there any parking?</button>
                <div class="accordion-panel" hidden>
                  <p>
                    There is on-street parking near St Margaret&rsquo;s Church, and plenty of parking is available at the Medley Walled Garden in a field next to the venue. We highly recommend walking between the church and the reception venue &mdash; not only is it a lovely stroll across Port Meadow, but it also helps avoid the ongoing construction on Botley Road.
                  </p>

                <div class="accordion-panel" hidden>
                  <p>
                    The music will end at 23:00, and our venue will ask guests to leave by 23:30. Because of ongoing construction work on the Botley Road, the easiest pick-up point for taxis will be in Jericho. We&rsquo;ll organise a short guided walk across Port Meadow from the reception to the taxi pick-up area so you won&rsquo;t need to worry about navigation or getting lost. Please book your taxi for around 23:30 (or shortly after) to make for a smooth departure. Uber is also available in Oxford.
